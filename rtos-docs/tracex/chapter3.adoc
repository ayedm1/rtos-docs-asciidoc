:description: This chapter describes the overall functionality of the TraceX system analysis tool, including the overall functionality of its GUI.

This chapter describes the overall functionality of the TraceX system analysis tool, including the overall functionality of its GUI.

== Display Overview

*Figure 4* shows the main display window of the TraceX system analysis tool. The layout is straightforward--the execution contexts are represented by the vertical elements on the left side; e.g., initialization, interrupt, idle, and the various thread entries. The events that take place in each context are displayed horizontally on the same context line. For example, the *QR* events shown below show that *_thread 2_* is making successive calls to *_tx_queue_receive_*.

*FIGURE 5*

Context changes are represented by the vertical black lines that connect the context lines. The currently selected event is represented by a solid red vertical line. In this example, event 494 is selected.

== Title Bar

The TraceX title bar provides several pieces of useful information. First is the current version of TraceX. Second is the full path of the currently opened trace file. The example in *Figure 6* shows *_TraceX_* version *_6.0.0_* is displaying the *_demo_threadx.trx_* trace file.

*FIGURE 6*

== Tool Bar

The TraceX tool bar provides several buttons to open trace files and control elements of their display.

== Display Mode Tabs

TraceX displays system events in two different ways: _sequential_ and _time relative_. The default mode is sequential and that is the mode shown in *Figure 8*.

Changing the mode is as simple as selecting the *_Sequential View_* or *_Time View_* tabs in the TraceX window. *Figure 8* shows the *_Sequential View_* and *_Time View_* tabs.

image::./media/user-guide/screen_shot_30.png[Screenshot of the Sequential View and Time View tabs.]

*FIGURE 8*

== Sequential View Mode

The sequential view mode is selected by the *_Sequential View_* tab shown in *Figure 8*. This is the default mode. In this mode, events are shown im../mediately following each other, regardless of the elapsed time between them. Note also the ruler above the display area in *Figure 8*. It shows the relative event number from the beginning of the trace.

This mode is the default mode and is useful in getting a good overview of what is going on in the system.

== Time View Mode

The time view mode is selected by the *_Time View_* button. *Figure 9* shows the same event trace as *Figure 8* except in time view mode. In this mode, events are shown in a time relative manner, with the solid green bar being used to show execution between events. This mode is useful to see where the bulk of processing is taking place in the system, which can help developers tune their system for greater performance and/or responsiveness.

image::./media/user-guide/screen_shot_31.png[Screenshot of the Time View tab.]

*FIGURE 9*

Note also the ruler above the event display in *Figure 9*. This ruler shows relative ticks from the beginning of the trace, as derived from the time stamp instrumented in the event trace logging inside of ThreadX. If the time stamps are too close (low frequency timer), the events will run together. Conversely, if the time stamps are too far apart (high frequency timer), then the events will be too far apart. Choosing the right frequency time stamp is an important consideration in making the time relative view meaningful.

== System Summary Line

TraceX also provides a single summary line (the top context in *Figure 10*) that includes all events on the same line. This makes it easy to see an overview of a complex system. The summary bar is especially beneficial in systems that have many threads. Without such a summary line, you would have to follow complex system interactions using the vertical scroll bar to follow the context of execution.

image::./media/user-guide/screen_shot_32.png[Screenshot of the System Summary Line in the Sequential View tab.]

*FIGURE 10*

The summary line contains a summary of the context as well as the corresponding event summary underneath. In the example shown in
*Figure 10,* it is easy to see that *_thread 2_* is executing and interrupted. The interrupt results in preemption by *_thread 3_*,
*_thread 6_*, *_thread 4_*, and *_thread 7_*, after which *_thread 2_* resumes execution.

== System Contexts

TraceX lists the system contexts on the left-hand side of the display, as shown in *Figure 11*. Events that occur in a particular context are displayed on the horizontal line to the right of that context. In this way, you can easily ascertain which context the event occurred as well as follow that context line to see all the events that occurred in a particular context.

The first tow context entries are always the *_Interrupt_* and *_Initialize/Idle_* contexts. *_Interrupt_* context represents all system events made from Interrupt Service Routines (IRS). *_Initialize/Idle_* context represents two contexts in ThreadX. Events that occur during *_tx_application_define_*, are *_Initialize/Idle_* context. If the system is idle and thus no events are occurring, the green bar representing *_Running_* in the time view is drawn on the *_Initialize/Idle_* context.

image::./media/user-guide/screen_shot_33.png[Screenshot of the system contexts on the left-hand side of the display.]

*FIGURE 11*

In the example in *Figure 11*, there are nine thread contexts, starting from the *_System Timer Thread_* context. Additional information about an individual context is available by placing the mouse on that context. The additional information includes the thread's starting stack address, ending stack address, total size, percent used, relative execution percentage, number of suspension, resumptions, and its highest and lowest priority during the trace. *Figure 12* shows information for *_thread 0_*.

image::./media/user-guide/screen_shot_34.png[Screenshot of the information for thread 0.]

*FIGURE 12*

Contexts may also be moved to group those of greater interest. This is accomplished by dragging and dropping the context or right-clicking on the context. Right-clicking on the context yields a dialog for moving the context to the top or the bottom.

Selecting *_Move to top_* results in the *_thread 3_* context being moved to the top of the context list, as shown in *Figure 13*.

image::./media/user-guide/screen_shot_35.png[Screenshot of the context being moved to the top of the context list.]

*FIGURE 13*

== Thread Status Information

When enabled, TraceX displays the status of each thread via a colored line on the thread's context. A green line indicates that the thread is in a "ready" state, while a line of any other color indicates the thread is suspended. For suspended threads, the color of the line indicates the type of ThreadX object that the thread is suspended on. For example, in *Figure 13* the green line on the *_System Timer Thread's_* context starting at event 147 shows that the *_System Timer Thread_* is ready. Prior to event 147 and after event 154, the absence of the green line indicates that the *_System Timer Thread_* is ready. Prior to event 147 and after event 154, the absence of the green line indicates that the *_System Timer Thread_* is suspended.

image::./media/user-guide/screen_shot_36.png[Screenshot of the status of each thread via a colored line on the thread's context.]

*FIGURE 14*

There are three modes of thread status display, available via the *_Options \-> Status Lines_* menu. The *_Ready Only_* option only shows the ready (green) status lines, but does not display any suspension status lines. This is the default option for TraceX. The *_All On_* option enables the display of all status lines (ready and suspension).

Finally, the *_All Off_* option disables the display of all status lines.

== Event Information Display

TraceX provides detailed information on some 600 run-time events, including ThreadX, FileX, NetX Duo, and USBX API calls and internal events. TraceX also supports up to an additional 61,439 unique user-defined events.

Regardless of whether sequential or time display mode is selected, a mouse-over on any event in the display area results in detailed event information displayed near the event. The mouse-over of event 143 in the demonstration *_demo_threadx.trx_* trace file is shown in *Figure 15*:

image::./media/user-guide/screen_shot_37.png[Screenshot of the mouse-over of event 143 in a sample trace file]

*FIGURE 15*

Each event displayed contains standard information about *_Context_* and both the *_Relative Time_* and *_Time Stamp_*. The Context field shows what context the event took place in. There are exactly four contexts: thread, idle, ISR, and initialization. When an event takes place in a thread context, the thread name and its priority at that time is gathered and displayed as shown above. The *_Relative Time_* shows the relative number of timer ticks from the beginning of the trace. The *_Raw Time Stamp_* displays the raw time source of the event. Finally, all event-specific information is displayed. This information is detailed throughout the remainder of this chapter.

Detailed event information is also available by double clicking on any event. Double clicking on event 143 is shown in *Figure 16*:

image::./media/user-guide/screen_shot_38.png[Screenshot of the detailed event information when an event is double clicked.]

*FIGURE 16*

Being able to view multiple events at once gives the user a much richer view of what happened. Seeing them side by side is quite useful since many events are interrelated. This is accomplished by double clicking on multiple events.

== Current Event Display

TraceX displays the current event--in a separate window--when selected by the user via *_View \-> Current Event_* or clicking on the current event button on the toolbar. After selected, TraceX displays the currently selected event in a stand-alone window and refreshes this window whenever another event is selected.

== Event Searching

TraceX provides an extensive event search capability. The event ID and information fields of each event are the primary search parameters. Not specifying a value for a search parameter indicates that parameter effectively removes that parameter from of the search. In addition, the search can be done such that any parameter found will satisfy the search or all parameters must be found to satisfy the search. The search may also be restricted to a particular context or cover all contexts in the trace. Invoking the event search is done by selecting the *_Search by Value_* button on the toolbar, as shown in *Figure 17*. When selected the search dialog is displayed, which specifies all the parameters for the search. The *_Next_* and *_Previous_* buttons in the search dialog can then be used to find the next and previous events that match the specified search criteria. *Figure 17* shows the search dialog.

image::./media/user-guide/screen_shot_39.png[Screenshot of the event search.]

*FIGURE 17*

*FIGURE 18*

== Zooming In and Out

By default, TraceX displays the events at their full size. You may zoom in or zoom out as desired. Zooming out is useful to see the overall events captured in the trace, while zooming in is useful in conditions where the events overlap because of the resolution of the time stamp source. *Figure 19* shows the *_demo_threadx.trx_* file zoomed out so that 100% of the trace file is shown.

image::./media/user-guide/screen_shot_41.png[Screenshot of a sample file zoomed out so that 100% of the trace file is shown.]

*FIGURE 19*

When zoomed out at 100% to show the entire trace within the current display page, it is easy to see all the context execution captured in the trace as well as the general events occurring within those contexts. Notice in *Figure 16* that *_thread 1_* and *_thread 2_* execute most often. The blue coloring for their events also suggests that these threads are making queue service calls (queue events are blue in color).

Restoring to a full icon view is equally easy; Either the zoom-in button may be selected repeatedly or some factor of 100 may be entered.

== Delta Ticks Between Events

Determining the number of ticks between various events in TraceX is easy--click on the starting event and drag the mouse to the ending event. The delta number of ticks between the events shows up in the upper right-hand corner of the display, as shown in *Figure 17*.

image::./media/user-guide/screen_shot_42.png[Screenshot of the delta number of ticks between the events.]

*FIGURE 17*

The delta ticks shown in *Figure 17* show that 5032 ticks have elapsed between event 125 and event 154. This could also be calculated manually by looking at the relative time stamps in each event and subtracting, but using the GUI is easy and instantaneous.

== Actual Time Display

When enabled, TraceX displays the actual time in microseconds in *_Time View_* and for the various delta time information displayed by TraceX. By default, the actual time display is disabled. To enable the actual time display, the number of ticks per microsecond must be entered via the *_Options \-> Ticks per Microsecond_* menu selection (the value to enter is determined by the hardware timer source used for the TraceX event logging on the target).

== Priority Inversions

TraceX automatically displays priority inversions detected in the trace file. Priority inversions are defined as conditions where a higher-priority thread is blocked trying to obtain a mutex that is currently owned by a lower-priority thread. This condition is termed _deterministic_, because the system was set up to operate in this manner. To inform the user, TraceX shows _deterministic_ priority inversion ranges as a light salmon color.

TraceX also displays _non-deterministic_ priority inversions. These priority inversions differ from the _deterministic_ priority inversions in that another thread of a different priority level has executed in the middle of what was a _deterministic_ priority inversion, thereby making the time within the priority inversion somewhat _non-deterministic_. This condition is often unknown to the user and can be very serious. In order to alert the user of this condition, TraceX shows _non-deterministic_ priority inversions as a brighter salmon color. *Figure 18* shows both _deterministic_ and _non-deterministic_ priority inversions.

image::./media/user-guide/screen_shot_43.png[Screenshot of the priority inversion in a trace file.]

*FIGURE 18*

*Figure 18* shows a _deterministic_ priority inversion from event 398 through event 402. In this range, the higher-priority *_thread 0_* blocks on a mutex owned by a lower-priority *_thread 1_*. At event 402, *_thread 1_* releases the mutex and thus ends the priority
inversion.

The brighter shaded area shows a _non-deterministic_ priority inversion between event 408 through event 420. What makes this _non-deterministic_ is that while *_thread 1_* holds the mutex that higher-priority *_thread 0_* is blocked on, an interrupt occurs that resumes *_thread 2_*, which then executes and lengthens the time the system is in priority inversion. This condition can be quite serious and difficult to identify; however, with TraceX it is easily identified.
