= Chapter 4 - TraceX performance analysis
:description: This chapter describes the TraceX performance analysis tool.

This chapter describes the TraceX performance analysis tool:

== Performance Analysis

TraceX provides built-in performance analysis of trace files. Information such as the _execution profile_, _popular services_, _thread stack usage_, and various _performance statistics,_ including FileX and NetX Duo statistics__,__ are readily available. This information is available via the *_View_* menu item.

== Execution Profile

Selecting the *_Generate Execution Profile_* button or *_View -Execution Profile_* presents the TraceX execution profile for the currently loaded trace file. The execution profile associated with the sample ThreadX demonstration trace is shown in *Figure 19*.

*FIGURE 19*

The example shown in *Figure 19* indicates that nearly 45% of the processing time is inside of *_thread 2_* and nearly 51% of the processing time is inside of *_thread 1_* This is logical since the bulk of the trace shows these threads sending and receiving messages. The remaining execution contexts have only a small amount of execution time in this example.

== Popular Services

Selecting *_View \->Popular Services_* presents the popular services in the currently loaded trace file. By default, this information is displayed for the entire system. However, the popular services for specific threads are also available. The popular services in the sample ThreadX demonstration trace are shown in *Figure 20*.

*FIGURE 20*

The example shown in *Figure 20* indicates that *_tx_queue_send_* and *_tx_queue_receive_* are the two most popular services in this trace. This is consistent with the behavior of the standard ThreadX demonstration from which this trace was captured.

Specific threads can be selected for this analysis by using the drop down selection list at the top of this window. *Figure 21* shows this analysis for *_thread 3_*.

== Thread Stack Usage image:./media/user-guide/screen_shot_17.png[Analysis for thread 3.]

Selecting the *_Generate Thread Stack Usage_* button or *_View \-> Thread Stack Usage_* presents the stack usage for each thread in the trace file. This is accomplished by ThreadX including the current thread stack pointer in many of the trace entries in the file. A stack usage of 100% indicates the stack has overflowed and must be corrected in the application. If there is no thread execution within this trace file, the stack usage for that thread is shown at 0%. The thread stack usage in the sample ThreadX demonstration trace is shown in *Figure 22*.

*FIGURE 22*

The example shown in *Figure 22* indicates that most threads in this trace have between 9% and 12% stack usage.

== Performance Statistics

Selecting the *_Generate Performance Statistics_* button or *_View \-> Performance Statistics_* presents the performance statistics of the currently loaded trace file. By default, this information is displayed for the entire system. However, the performance statistics are also available for each specific thread.

The performance statistics of the sample ThreadX demonstration trace are shown in *Figure 23*.

*FIGURE 23*

The example shown in *Figure 23* indicates that there were 18 context switches in this trace file, as well as five thread preemptions, 16 thread suspensions, 19 thread resumptions, and three interrupts. There were no priority inversions found in this trace file. Notice there are two categories of priority inversions, namely, _deterministic_ and _nondeterministic_. Deterministic priority inversions are priority inversion in which a thread is blocked on a mutex owned by a lower priority thread. An nondeterministic priority inversion is where a different lower priority thread runs during a deterministic priority inversion. The later can cause unforeseen timing behavior in the application and should be studied carefully.

== FileX Statistics

Selecting *_View \-> FileX Statistics_* presents the FileX performance statistics of the currently loaded trace file. This information is displayed for the entire system, on all opened ../media objects. The performance statistics of the sample FileX demonstration trace are shown in *Figure 24*.

image::./media/user-guide/filex_statistics.png[Screenshot of the FileX Statistics.]

*FIGURE 24*

The example shown in *Figure 27* indicates there were 19 ../media opens, 19 ../media closes, 19 ../media flushes, 18 directory reads, 19 directory writes, and 18 directory cache misses. Additional information can be viewed by scrolling down in the statistics window.

== NetX Duo Statistics

Selecting *_View -NetX Statistics_* presents the NetX Duo performance statistics of the currently loaded trace file. This information is displayed for the entire system. The performance statistics of the sample NetX Duo demonstration trace are shown in *Figure 25*.

image::./media/user-guide/netx_statistics.png[Screenshot of the NetX Statistics.]

*FIGURE 25*

The example shown in *Figure 25* indicates there were no ARP, Ping, or UDP events, but there were 30 IP packets sent, 1,368 IP bytes sent, 30 IP packets received, and 1,360 IP bytes received.

== Trace File Information

Selecting *_View \-> Trace File Information_* presents some basic information about the opened trace file. This information includes the byte order of the file, size of the time source, maximum number of bytes for each object name, and the base address of all trace file pointers. *Figure 26* shows the trace file information for the standard *_demo_threadx.trx_* trace file.

== Raw Trace Dump

Selecting *_View \-> Raw Trace Dump_* presents a dialog to name the file containing the raw trace dump. After the file name and path are entered, TraceX builds the raw trace file in text format and launches *_notepad.exe_* to display it. *Figure 27* shows the raw trace file dump for the standard *_demo_threadx.trx_* trace file.
