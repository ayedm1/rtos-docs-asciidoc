= Appendix D - Dumping and trace buffer
:description: Dumping the trace buffer created by ThreadX to a file on the host computer is done via commands and/or utilities provided by the specific development tool being used.

Dumping the trace buffer created by ThreadX to a file on the host computer is done via commands and/or utilities provided by the specific development tool being used. This appendix contains examples of dumping a trace buffer to a host file in some of the more popular development tools used with ThreadX.

== BenchX Tools

The trace buffer can be dumped to a host file easily with the BenchX tools by selecting the *_Store Memory To File_* button within the *_Memory View_*, as shown below:

At this point, specify the trace buffer address, size, destination file name (including path), and select the *_Save_* button as shown below. This will create the binary trace file for viewing within TraceX.

== RealView Tools

The trace buffer can be dumped to a host file easily with the ARM RealView tools by entering the following command at the command-line prompt in RealView:

[,c]
----
> WRITEFILE,raw trace_file.trx=0x6860..0xE560
----

Upon completion, the file *_trace_file.trx_* will contain the trace buffer that is located starting at the address 0x6860 and goes up to address 0xE560. This file is ready for viewing by TraceX.

== IAR Tools

The trace buffer can be dumped to a host file easily with the IAR tools by simply right-clicking in the memory view and selecting the *_Memory Save..._* option, as shown below.

image::./media/user-guide/image0_311.jpg[Screenshot of the Memory Save option in the IAR tools.]

This results in the *_Memory Save_* dialog to be displayed. Enter the starting and ending address and the trace file name, then select the *_Save_* button. In the example shown below, the IAR tools save the specified trace buffer into Intel HEX records in the file *_trace_file.hex_*.

At this point, we have the trace buffer saved in the *_trace_file.hex_* file on the host and is ready for viewing with
TraceX.

== CodeWarrior Tools

The trace buffer can be dumped to a host file easily with the CodeWarrior tools by entering the *_save_* command in the Command Window. The following example *_save_* command assumes the trace buffer starts at 0x102200 and ends at 0x109F00:

[,c]
----
> save –b p:0x102200..0x109F00 trace_file.trx -a 32bit
----

This results in the trace buffer being saved in the file
*_trace_file.trx_* on the host.

== MPLAB Tools

MPLAB can create a TraceX-compatible trace file through its Export Table utility, which allows the export of any range of memory to a host file. To use this utility to create a trace file for TraceX, proceed as follows:

*Step 1* Open a memory window by selecting View \-> Memory.

image::./media/user-guide/image0_316.jpg[Screenshot of the Memory selected on the View menu.]

*Step 2* Right-click within the *Memory View* to display a list of options. Specify *Display Format -1 Byte* to select byte display..

image::./media/user-guide/image651.jpg[Screenshot of the Go To dialog.]

*Step 3* Right-click again within the *Memory View* Window and select *Go To*, which opens a dialog box that enables you to specify the address of the event buffer. This example shows *_event_buffer_* being displayed.

*Step 4* This highlights the contents of the first location of the trace buffer, which is always the string BTXT....

*Step 5* Now, right-click again to bring up the options menu, and select *Export Table*.

image::./media/user-guide/image0_314.jpg[Screenshot of the Memory View with the Export Table option selected.]

*Step 6* This brings up the *Export Table* dialog, as shown. Specify the range of addresses to export. For an 8K trace buffer, as is the case in this example, specify the range 0xA00006AC to 0xA00026AC, and enter a name for the host file to be created (demo_threadx.trx in this example).

image::./media/user-guide/image656.jpg[Screenshot of the Export As dialog.]

*Step 7* A file named *demo_threadx.trx* will be created on the host, and this file can be opened by TraceX.

== GHS Tools

The trace buffer can be dumped to a host file easily with the GHS tools by entering the following command at the command-line prompt in the debug command window:

[,c]
----
memdump raw c:releasethreadxdemo_threadx.trx event_buffer 32768
----

Upon completion, the file *demo_threadx.trx* will contain the trace buffer that is located in the event_buffer with a size of 32,768 bytes and is ready for viewing by TraceX.

== Renesas HEW

The trace buffer can be dumped to a host file easily with the Renasas HEW tools by following the
three steps (and substeps) below:

*Step 1* Open Memory Window.

*Step 2* Place cursor within memory window and right click.

image::./media/user-guide/image0_315.jpg[Screenshot of the Memory Window with the Save option selected.]

*Step 3* Select Save, then in the Save Memory As window do the following:

* Select File format: Binary.
* Specify Filename: As Desired
* Specify Start address: trace_buffer
* Specify End address: (trace_buffer+size)
* Specify Access size: 1
* Click Save
