= Chapter 10 - Customer user events
:description: This chapter contains a description of how to create user-defined events and custom icons and information fields for such events.

This chapter contains a description of how to create user-defined events and custom icons and information fields for such events. This chapter includes the following sections:

== Inserting User-Defined Events

ThreadX provides the ability for developers to log their own user-defined events, providing even more useful information that can be viewed graphically by TraceX. User-defined event numbers range from

*TX_TRACE_USER_EVENT_START* (4096) through *TX_TRACE_USER_EVENT_END* (65535), inclusive. The placement of
the events in the trace buffer is done via the *_tx_trace_user_event_insert_*, defined in Chapter 5. The
following example calls insert two user-defined events into the current trace buffer on the target, namely user-defined event 4096 and event 4098:

[,c]
----
tx_trace_user_event_insert(4096, 1, 2, 3, 4);
tx_trace_user_event_insert(4098,0x100,0x200,0x300,0x400);
----

== Default Display of User-Defined Events

By default, TraceX displays all user events with a default user-defined Event icon as described in Chapter 6. Figure 28 shows the default user-defined event icon for events 452 and 453, which were placed in the event buffer via the previous
*_tx_trace_user_event_insert_* examples.

Detailed information is also available for user-defined Events. Figure 28 shows the detailed event information for event 452, which has event number 4096 and shows the specified four information fields.

== Defining Custom User-Defined Event Icons

TraceX also provides the user the ability to create custom user-defined event icons and custom information field labels. This capability is achieved by adding event icon specifications to the *_tracex_custom.trxc_* configuration file. This file is located in the *_CustomEvents_* subdirectory of your user-defined TraceX installation directory. An example directory path is shown in Figure 30.

*FIGURE 30*

The *_tracex_custom.trxc_* custom event configuration file is a simple ASCII text file containing zero or more custom event definitions. The format of the file is as follows:

[,c]
----
//Comments
**Start **
[custom event definition(s)] **End **
----

Each line between Start and End is used to define a single custom event. TraceX provides a template version of this file with no custom events defined (nothing between the "Start" and "End" labels). The
format of a custom event definition is as follows:

*number, name, abbreviation, top_color, bottom_color, label1, label2, label2, label4*

where:

* number: Defines the user-defined event number, between 4096 and 65535, inclusive.</th>
* name: Defines the logical name for the user-defined event.</td>
* abbreviation: Defines the two-letter user-defined event abbreviation.</td>
* top_color: Defines the RGB value for the top-half of the icon, which is a three-digit number in parenthesis. Some typical
RGB definitions are
 ** BLACK = (0,0,0)
 ** WHITE = (255,255,255)
 ** RED = (255,0,0)
 ** GREEN = (0,255,0)
 ** BLUE = (0,0,255)
 ** YELLOW = (255,255,0)
 ** CYAN = (0,255,255)
 ** MAGENTA = (255,0,255) +
Using the RBG specification gives the user a broad range of colors for each user-defined icon. For more information on RBG color definition, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB#Digital_representations
* bottom_color: Defines the RGB value for the bottom half of the icon, which is a three-digit number in parenthesis.
* label1: Label for *_info_field_1_*, as specified in the *_tx_trace_user_event_insert_* call.
* label2: Label for *_info_field_2_*, as specified in the *_tx_trace_user_event_insert_* call.
* label3: Label for *_info_field_3_*, as specified in the *_tx_trace_user_event_insert_* call.
* label4: Label for *_info_field_4_*, as specified in the *_tx_trace_user_event_insert_* call.

Example definitions for each of the two user-defined events used in this chapter are shown in Figure 10.4. The first definition is for event 4096 at line 5 of the *_tracex_custom.trxc_* file. This definition gives user-defined event 4096 the name *First_User_Event*, specifies a two-letter abbreviation of *FE*, makes the top portion of the icon red, the bottom portion of the icon green, and names the information fields as *First_Info1*, *First_Info2*, *First_Info3*, and *First_Info4*. User-defined event 4098 is defined similarly at line 6 of *_tracex_custom.trxc_*.

*FIGURE 31*

Since the *_tracex_custom.trxc_* file is read by TraceX during initialization, TraceX must be exited and restarted before the custom icon definitions can take effect. Figure 32 shows the TraceX display of user-defined events 452 and 453 with the custom event icons defined in *_tracex_custom.trxc_*.

The additional information in the custom event definition is shown when the event you select using a double-click, mouse-over, or clicking the current event button. Figure 33 shows the double-click selection on event 452. The event name and information fields all match the sample definition that was added to *_tracex_custom.trxc_*.
