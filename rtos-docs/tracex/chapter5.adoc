= Chapter 5 - Generating trace buffers
:description: This chapter contains a description about how to build a TraceX event buffer and also describes the underlying format of the buffer.

This chapter contains a description about how to build a TraceX event buffer and also describes the underlying format of the buffer.

== ThreadX Event Trace Support

ThreadX provides built-in event trace support for all ThreadX services, thread state changes, and user-defined events. The ThreadX event-trace capability is primarily designed as a post-mortem tool to analyze the last "n" activities in the application. From this information, the developer may spot problems and/or potential targets of optimization.

TraceX graphically displays the event trace buffer built by ThreadX. The following describes how to build the buffer and describes the underlying format of the buffer.

== Enabling Event Trace

To enable event trace, define the time-stamp constants, build the ThreadX library with *TX_ENABLE_EVENT_TRACE* defined, and enable tracing by calling the *tx_trace_enable* function.

== Defining Time-Stamp Constants

The time-stamp constants are designed to provide the developer control over the time-stamp used in the event trace entries. The two time-stamp constants and their default values are as follows:

[,c]
----
#ifndef TX_TRACE_TIME_SOURCE
#define TX_TRACE_TIME_SOURCE ++_tx_trace_simulated_time
#endif
#ifndef TX_TRACE_TIME_MASK
#define TX_TRACE_TIME_MASK   0xFFFFFFFFUL
#endif
----

The above constants are defined in *tx_port.h* and create a "fake" time-stamp that simply increments by one on each event. The following is an example of an actual timestamp definition:

[,c]
----
#ifndef TX_TRACE_TIME_SOURCE
#define TX_TRACE_TIME_SOURCE ((ULONG) 0x0x13000004)
#endif
#ifndef TX_TRACE_TIME_MASK
#define TX_TRACE_TIME_MASK 0xFFFFFFFFUL
#endif
----

The above constants specify a 32-bit timer that is obtained by reading the address 0x13000004. Most application specific time-stamps should be setup in a similar fashion.

== Exporting the Trace Buffer

TraceX needs the trace buffer in a binary, Intel HEX, or Motorola S-Record file format on the host. The easiest way to accomplish this is to stop the target and instruct your debugger to dump the memory area you supplied to *_tx_trace_enable_* function into a file on the host.

WARNING: *_Be careful not to stop the target within a trace gathering code itself. Doing so can cause invalid trace information. If the program is halted within ThreadX, it is best to step over any trace insert macro before dumping the trace buffer._*

IMPORTANT: _Appendix D shows how to dump the trace buffer from within a variety of development tools._

== Extended Event Trace API

When ThreadX is built with *TX_ENABLE_EVENT_TRACE* defined, the following new event trace APIs are available to the application:

* tx_trace_enable: _Enable event tracing_
* tx_trace_event_filter: _Filter specified event(s)_
* tx_trace_event_unfilter: _Unfilter specified event(s)_
* tx_trace_disable: _Disable event tracing_
* tx_trace_isr_enter_insert: _Insert ISR enter trace event_
* tx_trace_isr_exit_insert: _Insert ISR exit trace event_
* tx_trace_buffer_full_notify: _Register trace buffer full application callback_
* tx_trace_user_event_insert: _Insert user event_

=== tx_trace_enable

Enable event tracing

==== Prototype

[,c]
----
UINT tx_trace_enable (VOID *trace_buffer_start,
     ULONG trace_buffer_size, ULONG registry_entries);
----

==== Description

This service enables event tracing inside ThreadX. The trace buffer and the maximum number of ThreadX objects are supplied by the
application.

IMPORTANT: The ThreadX library and application must be built with *TX_ENABLE_EVENT_TRACE* defined in order to use event tracing.

==== Input Parameters

* *trace_buffer_start*: Pointer to the start of the user-supplied trace buffer.
* *trace_buffer_size*: Total number of bytes in the memory for the trace buffer. The larger the trace buffer, the more entries it is able to store.
* *registry_entries*: Number of application ThreadX objects to keep in the trace registry. The registry is used to correlate object addresses with object names. This is highly useful for GUI trace analysis tools.

==== Return Values

* *TX_SUCCESS* (0x00) Successful event trace enable.
* *TX_SIZE_ERROR* (0x05) Specified trace buffer size is too small. It must be large enough for the trace header, the object registry, and at least one trace entry.
* *TX_NOT_DONE* (0x20) Event tracing was already enabled.
* *TX_FEATURE_NOT_ENABLED* (0xFF) System was not compiled with trace enabled.

==== Allowed From

Initialization and threads

==== Example

[,c]
----
UCHAR my_trace_buffer[64000];

/* Enable event tracing using the global "my_trace_buffer" memory and supporting a maximum of 30 ThreadX objects in the registry. */
status = tx_trace_enable (&my_trace_buffer, 64000, 30);

/* If status is TX_SUCCESS the event tracing is enabled. */
----

=== tx_trace_event_filter

Filter specified events

==== Prototype

[,c]
----
UINT tx_trace_event_filter (ULONG  vent_filter_bits);
----

==== Description

This service filters the specified event(s) from being inserted into the active trace buffer. Note that by default no events are filtered after _tx_trace_enable_ is called.

IMPORTANT: The ThreadX library and application must be built with *TX_ENABLE_EVENT_TRACE* defined in order to use event tracing.

==== Input Parameters

* *event_filter_bits*: Bits that correspond to events to filter. Multiple events may be filtered by simply oring together the
appropriate constants. Valid constants for this variable are defined as follows:

==== Register trace buffer full application callback

==== Prototype

[,c]
----
VOID tx_trace_buffer_full_notify (VOID (*full_buffer_callback)(VOID *));
----

==== Description

This service registers an application callback function that is called by ThreadX when the trace buffer becomes full. The application can then choose to disable tracing and/or possibly setup a new trace buffer.

IMPORTANT: The ThreadX library and application must be built with *TX_ENABLE_EVENT_TRACE* defined in order to use event tracing.

==== Input Parameters

   ULONG info_field_3, ULONG info_field_4);
----

==== Description

This service inserts the user event into the trace buffer. User event IDs must be greater than the constant *TX_TRACE_USER_EVENT_START*, which is defined to be 4096. The maximum user event is defined by the constant *TX_TRACE_USER_EVENT_END*, which is defined to be 65535. All events within this range are available to the application. The information fields are application specific.

IMPORTANT: The ThreadX library and application must be built with *TX_ENABLE_EVENT_TRACE* defined in order to use event tracing.
