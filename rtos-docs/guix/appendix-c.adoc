:description: Learn about the GUIX widget styles.

***_General Styles (Used with most widget types):_***

*GX_STYLE_BORDER_NONE*

* Value: 0x00000000
* Description: Use this style to draw a widget with no border.

*GX_STYLE_BORDER_RAISED*

* Value: 0x00000001
* Description: Draw widget with a raised border.

*GX_STYLE_BORDER_RECESSED*

* Value: 0x00000002
* Description: Draw widget with a recessed border.

*GX_STYLE_BORDER_THIN*

* Value: 0x00000004
* Description: Draw a one-pixel width border.

*GX_STYLE_BORDER_THICK*

* Value: 0x00000008
* Description: Draw widget with a thick border.

*GX_STYLE_BORDER_MASK*

* Value: 0x0000000f
* Description: Mask value used to test only the style fields of the widget style member.

*GX_STYLE_TRANSPARENT*

* Value: 0x10000000
* Description: Create a widget that is at least partially transparent. This style should be used when a widget does not draw itself fully opaque, including widgets that draw a semi-transparent pixelmap as the widget background. This style flag informs GUIX that the widget parent must be drawn to refresh the widget background area.

*GX_STYLE_DRAW_SELECTED*

* Value: 0x20000000
* Description: Specify that the widget should be drawn using selected state colors and fonts. Different widget types use the DRAW_SELECTED style in different ways to indicate the widget is
currently selected.

*GX_STYLE_ENABLED*

* Value: 0x40000000
* Description: Mark the widget as enabled, which allows the widget to accept user input events and generate output signals.

*GX_STYLE_DYNAMICALLY_ALLOCATED*

* Value: 0x80000000
* Description: Indicates the widget control block memory is dynamically allocated using the gx_system_memory_allocator service when the widget is created, and the control block memory is freed if the widget is destroyed.

*GX_STYLE_USE_LOCAL_ALPHA*

* Value: 0x01000000
* Description: Instructs GUIX drawing functions to use the local widget alpha value when drawing the widget. This flag is normally used by the internal GUIX logic to implement widget fading
animations.

***_Text Alignment Styles (styles applied to all widgets that draw text):_***

*GX_STYLE_TEXT_LEFT*

* Value: 0x00001000
* Description: Text is drawn left-aligned within the widget client area.

*GX_STYLE_TEXT_RIGHT*

* Value: 0x00002000
* Description: Text is drawn right-aligned within the widget client
area.

*GX_STYLE_TEXT_CENTER*

* Value: 0x00004000
* Description: Text is drawn center-aligned within the widget client area.

*GX_STYLE_TEXT_COPY*

* Value: 0x00008000
* Description: By default, widgets that draw text keep only a pointer to the text which is passed in by the application. For statically defined text that is defined within the string table, there is no reason for the widget to make a private copy of the text assigned. However, if the text assigned to a widget is created dynamically using functions like sprint() or gx_utility_ltoa, then it is often convenient to tell the widget to keep it's own private copy of any text assigned. This allows the application to use automatic or temporary variables when defining the text string, when the application would otherwise be required to define statically defined character arrays for each text widget that is using dynamically defined text. When this style flag is set, the widget will use the gx_system_memory_allocator function to dynamically allocate the memory block needed to hold a private copy of the assigned string. Therefore using this style flag is predicated on the application defining memory_allocator and memory_deallocator functions. GX_STYLE_TEXT_COPY should not be cleared after it has been set, and doing so will cause unpredictable results.

***_Button Styles (apply only to GUIX button widget types):_***

*GX_STYLE_BUTTON_PUSHED*

* Value 0x00000010
* Description: Indicates the button is in the pushed or selected state.

*GX_STYLE_BUTTON_TOGGLE*

* Value 0x00000020
* Description: Button will switch status between pushed and unpushed on every click event. This style is commonly used with "checkbox" style buttons.

*GX_STYLE_BUTTON_RADIO*

* Value 0x00000040
* Description: This style indicates the button will be exclusive, and deselect any button siblings when selected. This style is commonly used with "radio button" style buttons.

*GX_STYLE_BUTTON_EVENT_ON_PUSH*

* Value: 0x00000080
* Description: Indicates the button generates a click event when initially pushed. The default operation is to generate a click event when the button is released.

*GX_STYLE_BUTTON_REPEAT*

* Value 0x00000100
* Description: Indicates the button should send repeated click events to the button parent when the button is held in the pushed state.

*GX_STYLE_VALIGN_BOTTOM*

* Value: 0x00200000
* Description: The button pixelmap should be bottom aligned within the button boundary on the vertical horizontal axis.

***_Slider Styles (Apply only to GX_SLIDER and derived widget types):_***

*GX_STYLE_SHOW_NEEDLE*

* Value: 0x00000200
* Description: This style must be included for the slider to draw the needle indicator. This style can be disabled if the application wants to disable the slider needle or draw a custom needle indicator.
