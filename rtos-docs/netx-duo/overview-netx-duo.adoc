= Overview of NetX Duo
:description: NetX Duo is an advanced, industrial-grade TCP/IP network stack is designed specifically for deeply embedded real-time and IoT applications.

NetX Duo embedded TCP/IP network stack is Eclipse Foundation's advanced, industrial grade dual IPv4 and IPv6 TCP/IP network stack that is designed specifically for deeply embedded, real-time, and IoT applications. NetX Duo provides embedded applications with core network protocols such as IPv4, IPv6, TCP, and UDP as well as a complete suite of additional, higher-level add-on protocols. NetX Duo offers security via additional add-on security products, including NetX Duo Secure IPsec and NetX Duo Secure SSL/TLS/DTLS. All of this combined with a small footprint, fast execution, and superior ease-of-use make NetX Duo the ideal choice for the most demanding embedded IoT applications.

== Safe and secure

NetX Duo is secure. This security is provided through add-on security products, including IPsec, SSL, TLS, and DTLS. Also, the application has complete control over all external access to NetX Duo, making security risk determination much easier.

Eclipse ThreadX provides OEMs with components to secure communication and to create code and data isolation using underlying MCU/MPU hardware protection mechanisms. It is ultimately the responsibility of the device builder to ensure the device fully meets the evolving security requirements associated with its specific use case.

== Interoperability verification

NetX Duo conforms to RFC standards and offers complete interoperability with devices for most vendors.
